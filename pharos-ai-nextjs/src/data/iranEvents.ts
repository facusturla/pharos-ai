Multiple large explosions reported across the capital. Iranian air defenses were simultaneously suppressed by Tomahawk cruise missile volleys from the USS Gerald R. Ford CSG.',
    fullContent: `At 04:32 UTC on February 28, 2026, US and Israeli forces launched the opening strikes of a coordinated campaign against Iran.

US Air Force B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, operating from Diego Garcia, delivered the first munitions against leadership compounds in Tehran. Simultaneously, IDF F-35I Adir jets struck Khamenei's residential compound in Saadatabad, northwest Tehran. Multiple secondary explosions were observed by satellite.

US Navy Tomahawk cruise missiles from the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group targeted Iranian S-300 and SA-65 air defense batteries in western Iran to suppress retaliatory capability. Pentagon officials confirmed the operation had been in planning for several months.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a public statement within minutes of the strikes commencing: "The IDF is striking the head of the snake." Trump posted a video to Truth Social stating that the US had launched operations alongside Israel to destroy Iran's nuclear program and missile capability.

Iranian state television was disrupted but resumed broadcast within 30 minutes. Initial reports from Tehran residents described a sequence of heavy explosions followed by sustained anti-aircraft fire visible across the city.`,

    fullContent: `At approximately 05:50 UTC, USAF B-2 Spirit bombers delivered 14 GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) — the world's most powerful conventional bunker-buster bomb — against the deeply buried nuclear enrichment facilities at Fordow and Natanz.

Fordow, buried 80–100m beneath a mountain near Qom, had been assessed as the most hardened nuclear facility in Iran. The facility housed approximately 1,000 IR-1 centrifuges. Multiple MOPs were required to penetrate to the facility level. Initial BDA (bomb damage assessment) via satellite indicates catastrophic structural damage.

Natanz, the primary uranium enrichment site, was struck with additional GBU-57s and conventional JDAMs. The above-ground pilot fuel enrichment plant was simultaneously targeted by Israeli F-15I aircraft.

Foundation for Defense of Democracies confirmed via FDD Action: "This is the largest B-2 operational strike in US history." The strike employed 14 of the roughly 20 MOPs believed to be in the US arsenal.

IAEA Director General confirmed loss of safeguards sensor contact with both Fordow and Natanz approximately 40 minutes after the strikes. Russia immediately called for an emergency IAEA Board of Governors session.

Former US National Security Advisor John Bolton: "This is exactly what should have been done 20 years ago."`,

The Strait, at its narrowest just 21 nautical miles wide between Iran and Oman, is the world's most critical energy chokepoint. More than 14 million barrels per day — approximately one-third of global seaborne crude exports — transit the Strait annually, along with significant volumes of LNG.

Shipping reports confirmed over 200 vessels, including oil tankers, LNG carriers, and container ships, dropped anchor in the waters approaching the Strait. The IRGC deployed fast-attack craft and threatened to fire upon any vessel attempting transit.

Reuters confirmed: "At least three tankers in the Gulf have been damaged since the U.S. and Israel began trading strikes with Iran. It is unclear whether the damage was done deliberately or accidentally."

Maersk statement: "We have paused Trans-Suez sailings through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait for the moment. Some sailings will be rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope. All vessel crossings in the Strait of Hormuz are also suspended."

Oil futures spiked approximately 35% in after-hours trading. Brent crude hit $143/barrel. US gasoline futures jumped significantly. Economists warned of a severe supply shock if the closure persists beyond 1–2 weeks.

    fullContent: `Following IRNA's confirmation of Supreme Leader Khamenei's death, large crowds of Iranians took to the streets of Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, and other cities in scenes of celebration.

The New York Times reported: "Large crowds of Iranians poured into the streets of Tehran and other cities across Iran overnight, celebrating the news that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had been killed during a day of coordinated U.S. and Israeli attacks."

This development has significant intelligence implications. The 2025–2026 Iranian protests — described as the largest since the Islamic Revolution — were met with a massacre of thousands of civilians by regime security forces in January 2026. Trump had stated "help is on the way" in response to the crackdown.

The celebratory response suggests a significant portion of the Iranian population views the regime's collapse as positive. This undermines the regime's claim to represent the Iranian people and complicates the IRGC's ability to mobilize domestic support for continued retaliation.

Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), speaking on CNN, stated: "I saw no intelligence that Iran was on the verge of launching any kind of preemptive strike against the United States of America. None." This directly contradicted the Trump administration's stated justification for the operation.

Maersk confirmed it was pausing all Trans-Suez sailings and rerouting available vessels via the Cape of Good Hope. Other major carriers including CMA CGM and MSC were assessing their routes.

The Bab el-Mandeb closure, combined with the Strait of Hormuz closure, has effectively bottled up oil and gas exports from the Persian Gulf entirely. Lloyd's of London declared a "war risk" zone covering the entire Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and Arabian Sea — triggering insurance rate spikes.

Houthi actions had previously disrupted approximately 15% of global trade during 2024–2025. The resumption of attacks following a period of relative calm significantly widens the conflict's economic impact.

• Explosions rocked Shahrak-e Gharb district (upscale residential area with apartment complexes and shopping centers).
• Massive explosions heard near Azadi Stadium, Azadi Square, and the Milad Tower area.

Nuclear-related:
• Isfahan nuclear complex — above-ground administration and research buildings.
• Parchin military complex — explosive research and testing facility (CSIS reports).
• Iran Atomic Energy Agency headquarters, Tehran (unverified per CSIS).

Military:
• IRGC Navy frigate struck — CENTCOM confirmed an Iranian Jamaran-class corvette was struck and was "sinking to the bottom of the Gulf of Oman."
• IDF confirmed striking Iranian F-4 and F-5 fighter jets as they prepared for takeoff from a runway.

    summary:   'President Trump told CNBC the operation is "moving along very well — ahead of schedule." He described it as "a very noble mission for the world." However, Senate Intelligence Committee ranking member Mark Warner stated he had seen "no intelligence" suggesting Iran was planning a preemptive strike — directly contradicting the administration\'s legal justification. Congressional Democrats demanded briefings.',
    fullContent: `President Trump conducted a phone interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen from Mar-a-Lago on the morning of March 1, 2026:

"We're moving along very well, very well — ahead of schedule. It's a very violent regime, one of the most violent regimes in history. We're doing our job not just for us but for the world. And everything is ahead of schedule."

Trump described a potential off-ramp: "Things are evolving in a very positive way right now, a very positive way." He did not specify terms for a ceasefire.

However, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and cleared for highly classified intelligence, contradicted the administration's justification:

"I saw no intelligence that Iran was on the verge of launching any kind of preemptive strike against the United States of America. None." Warner was responding to a senior Trump official's claim that "we had analysis that basically told us, if we sat back and waited to get hit first, the amount of casualties and damage would be substantially higher."

Republican counterpart Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) defended the strikes: "President Trump is right that it is absolutely vital and necessary now to address that threat before it fully materializes in the near future."

This political divide has significant implications for the operation's legal standing under the War Powers Resolution and for the bipartisan support required for sustained funding.`,

    summary:   'Iran announced the formation of a three-member transitional leadership council to assume the powers of the Supreme Leader following Khamenei\'s killing. The council consists of President Masoud Pezeshkian, Chief Justice Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, and Ayatollah Alireza Arafi (selected as the Guardian Council\'s representative). The Guardian Council spokesperson said a new supreme leader "must be determined as soon as possible" but "given wartime conditions, this will take place at the earliest opportunity." This is unprecedented — Iran has had only two supreme leaders since the 1979 revolution.',
    fullContent: `Iran announced the formation of a three-member transitional leadership council to govern the country following the death of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Constitutional basis: Iran's constitution provides for a transitional council to exercise the powers of the Supreme Leader until the Assembly of Experts selects a successor. The council consists of three members per Article 111.

Council members:
• President Masoud Pezeshkian — reformist president elected August 2024. Had been out of public sight since the strikes began; resurfaced March 1 to announce the council's formation.
• Chief Justice Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei — hardliner, appointed by Khamenei in 2021. Closely linked to the judiciary's role in suppressing 2022 Mahsa Amini protests.
• Ayatollah Alireza Arafi — 67-year-old Shia cleric, member of the Guardian Council. Selected as the "jurist member" (faqih) of the council, effectively the interim religious authority. Head of Iran's Islamic Seminaries. Considered a conservative loyalist.

Hadi Tahan Nazif, Guardian Council spokesperson, told IRIB News: "The constitution has provisions for the current circumstances, and until a leader is appointed, the leadership council will assume responsibility. Given the wartime conditions, this will take place at the earliest opportunity."

This is historically unprecedented — Iran has had only two supreme leaders: Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (1979–1989) and Ali Khamenei (1989–2026). The succession mechanism has never been tested under wartime conditions, with significant portions of the military and political leadership killed.

NBC News analysis: Richard Engel noted that with "dozens of Iran's top leaders killed" per Israeli claims and strikes still ongoing, "the leadership role is in crisis." The Assembly of Experts — the 88-member clerical body responsible for selecting a new Supreme Leader — has itself likely suffered casualties.`,

Trump warned: "We'll do everything possible to prevent more casualties. But America will avenge their deaths and deliver the most punishing blow to the terrorists who have waged war against, basically, civilization."

Trump added that "there will likely be more" American casualties before the operation ends.

    fullContent: `On the afternoon of March 1 (local time), an Iranian ballistic missile struck a residential neighborhood in Beit Shemesh, a city located approximately 30km west of Jerusalem.

Casualty details (Magen David Adom emergency service):
• 9 killed
• 28 taken to hospitals
• More than 40 total injured
• 16-year-old Gavriel Baruch identified as the fourth named victim

Impact details:
• The missile destroyed a synagogue in the neighborhood.
• A public bomb shelter beneath the synagogue suffered extensive damage from the direct hit.
• Some victims had been sheltering in the communal bunker, per ZAKA (Israeli body recovery organization) spokesperson Zeev Druck.
• Others were found out in the open.
• About a dozen houses in the vicinity showed heavy damage — doors and windows blown open, rubble and broken tile scattered in streets.

At the scene: approximately 200 people gathered, among them police officers and first responders. Bulldozers and heavy equipment were securing the site, collecting forensic evidence and taking witness statements.

An Israeli military search-and-rescue spokesperson at the scene stated it was evidence that Iran was targeting civilians, "pointing out that there were no military bases or command centers in the vicinity."

This was the deadliest single strike on Israeli territory during the conflict — 8 of the 10 total Israeli deaths occurred here.

Separately, an Iranian missile struck a highway on Jerusalem's outskirts, leaving a large crater and injuring 3 people (one in moderate condition). Police bomb disposal experts conducted searches for additional munitions.`,

    fullContent: `President Trump announced on Truth Social that the US military was systematically destroying Iran's navy.

Trump statement: "Nine of their warships have been destroyed and sunk. The rest of Iran's fleet of military vessels will soon be floating at the bottom of the sea, also! In a different attack, we largely destroyed their naval headquarters."

Earlier, CENTCOM had confirmed at least one specific naval engagement: "An Iranian Jamaran-class corvette was struck by U.S. forces as part of Operation Epic Fury. The ship was sinking to the bottom of the Gulf of Oman."

CENTCOM added a direct message to Iran's remaining naval personnel: "As the President said, members of Iran's armed forces, IRGC and police 'must lay down your weapons.' Abandon ship."

The systematic destruction of Iran's navy aligns with the broader US strategy of eliminating Iran's ability to threaten the Strait of Hormuz and Persian Gulf shipping lanes. Iran's conventional navy (IRIN) and the IRGC Navy together operate an estimated 200+ vessels, though many are small fast-attack craft rather than warships.

    summary:   'Iran\'s IRGC claimed it fired four ballistic missiles at the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier. US Central Command responded that the "missiles launched didn\'t even come close" and confirmed the Lincoln was continuing to launch aircraft. The IRGC had been quoted by state-run IRNA as claiming the strike was successful — CENTCOM directly contradicted the claim.',
    fullContent: `Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the country's most powerful military body, claimed via state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) that four ballistic missiles had targeted the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72).

CENTCOM response on X: The missiles "didn't even come close." CENTCOM confirmed the Lincoln was continuing to launch aircraft and conducting normal flight operations.

The USS Abraham Lincoln is one of the primary US carrier strike groups deployed to the region as part of Operation Epic Fury. The carrier is operating in the Gulf of Oman / Arabian Sea — outside the Persian Gulf itself.

The failed attempt to strike a US carrier is significant for several reasons:
1. It demonstrates IRGC intent to target capital warships, not just bases.
2. It demonstrates the failure of Iran's anti-ship ballistic missile capability against a maneuvering carrier with layered air and missile defense.
3. The IRGC's public claim of success, directly contradicted by CENTCOM, follows Iran's pattern of overstating military achievements (as in the April 2024 True Promise operation).

IDF had previously confirmed shooting down 50+ drones launched at Israel from Iran during this period.`,

    fullContent: `Oil markets:
• Brent crude: surged approximately 14% when trading opened at 6 PM ET Sunday.
• WTI (US crude): surged approximately 12%.
• Oil prices had already risen 17% this year before the strikes, driven by Trump administration rhetoric and escalating sanctions on Iran.

OPEC+ response:
• Eight OPEC+ nations announced plans to increase collective production by 206,000 barrels of crude oil per day.
• Analysts noted the increase was modest relative to the disruption — Iran produces less than 5% of global output, but more than 20% of daily global oil supply passes through the Strait of Hormuz.

Aviation disruptions (as of March 1):
• More than 1,500 flights to Middle East destinations cancelled (Cirium aviation analytics).

On operations: "We expect casualties with something like this. We have three, but we expect casualties — but in the end it's going to be a great deal for the world. We're moving along very well — ahead of schedule."

On desired outcome: "There are many outcomes that are good. Number one is decapitating them, getting rid of their whole group of killers and thugs. And there are many, many outcomes. We could do the short version or the longer version."

On diplomacy: Iranian officials are interested in continuing talks (referencing the Geneva channel through Oman). Asked whether the US will pause strikes during diplomatic efforts: "I don't know. If they can satisfy us. They haven't been able to."

On the pre-strike negotiations: A senior administration official revealed that Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi insisted in a Thursday meeting with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner that Iran had the "inalienable right" to enrich uranium. Witkoff replied: "We have the inalienable right to stop you." The US proposed a 10-year enrichment moratorium — Iran refused. Araghchi also declined to share a seven-page document Iran had prepared. Kushner and Witkoff reported to Trump how poorly negotiations had gone, and Trump was "nonplussed."

Senior White House official: Trump will "eventually" talk to "new potential leadership in Iran." "For now, Operation Epic Fury continues unabated."

Trump to Iranian citizens (Truth Social): "Iranian patriots who yearn for freedom — seize this moment, be brave, be bold, be heroic and take back your country. America is with you. I made a promise to you, and I fulfilled that promise. The rest will be up to you, but we'll be there to help."`,

    fullContent: `Diplomatic and political developments on the evening of March 1:

Oman backchannel:
Omani FM Badr al-Busaidi posted on social media: "Talks in Geneva made genuine progress towards an unprecedented agreement between Iran and the United States and although the hope was to avoid war, war should not mean that the hope of peace is extinguished. I still believe in the power of diplomacy to resolve this conflict. The sooner talks are resumed the better it is for everyone."

He had earlier lamented that ongoing negotiations with Iran had been undermined by the strikes and warned that US and global interests could suffer if military operations escalate.

UK position:
PM Keir Starmer gave consent for the US to use British military bases — including RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus and RAF Fairford — for defensive operations related to the conflict. The UK characterized its support as defensive in nature.

Congressional response:
• Congress will receive classified briefings Tuesday — Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine will brief the full membership of both chambers.
• Senate briefing at 3:30 PM ET, House briefing at 5 PM ET.
• War Powers Resolution push: Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) is seeking a vote, saying it would be "close — it depends if we can keep several Democrats in line."
• Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) on Meet the Press: Called Khamenei's death a "good thing" but criticized: "Hope is not a strategy. We got to have a plan here. What is the strategic goal, and how do we achieve it?"
• Rep. Khanna: "The ayatollah was 86. They were picking the new leader before we killed the ayatollah. The question is, is the country going to descend into civil war?"
• Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC): "It's not our job to pick Iran's next leader. Our job is to make sure Iran is no longer the largest state sponsor of terrorism. No boots on the ground."`,

The IDF intercepted one rocket; several others fell in open areas. Hezbollah is suspected but has not confirmed responsibility.

    fullContent: `Late on March 1 / early March 2 (local time), sirens were activated across northern Israel.

IDF statement: Projectiles fired from Lebanon. One rocket intercepted; several additional rockets fell in open areas and were not intercepted "in accordance with the military's policies." No reports of casualties or damage.

Sirens sounded in:
• Haifa and surrounding areas
• Multiple locations in the Upper Galilee
• Additional alerts for suspected drone infiltrations in the Upper Galilee

Attribution:
• Hebrew media reports indicate Hezbollah is behind the rocket fire, though the group has not confirmed this.
• It would mark the first time Hezbollah has joined Iran in its attacks on Israel during this conflict.
• It would also be the first violation of the US-brokered Israel-Lebanon ceasefire that went into effect in November 2024.
• Hezbollah did not get involved during the previous Israel-Iran exchanges (June 2025).

The IDF separately confirmed it had shot down over 50 drones launched at Israel from Iran throughout the day.

The potential opening of a northern front represents the most significant escalation risk of the conflict. Hezbollah maintains an estimated 130,000+ rockets and missiles, making it the most heavily armed non-state actor in history.

AI was reportedly used for intelligence assessment, target identification, and operational simulations — marking a milestone in AI-integrated military operations.',
    fullContent: `Reuters: "The Pentagon used artificial intelligence services from Anthropic, including its Claude tools, during its attack on Iran, according to a source familiar with the situation."

The Guardian: "The US military reportedly used Claude, Anthropic's AI model, to inform its attack on Iran despite Donald Trump's decision, announced hours earlier, to sever all ties with the company."

Key details:
• Pentagon had contracts worth up to $200 million with Anthropic for AI capabilities.
• Anthropic was among a small group of AI developers (alongside Google and others) awarded Pentagon contracts.
• The dispute stemmed from Anthropic's "refusal to allow unrestricted military use of its AI models, especially for controversial purposes such as fully autonomous weapons or mass surveillance."
• AI was integrated in intelligence assessment, target identification, and operational simulations.
• WION News: "One thing is now very clear: AI has become deeply integrated in US military planning and execution by early 2026."

The use of Claude AI in a major military operation marks a significant milestone — the first confirmed use of a large language model in the planning of a state-on-state military campaign.`,

    location:  'Southern Lebanon / Beirut / Northern Israel',
    summary:   'Hezbollah launched missiles and drones at northern Israel overnight, claiming the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Khamenei. The IDF responded within hours, striking Hezbollah targets across southern Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley, and Beirut\'s Dahieh suburb. Lebanon\'s health ministry reported 31 killed and 149 wounded. IDF chief Eyal Zamir said Israelis should "prepare for many prolonged days of combat ahead." The IDF urged residents of nearly 50 Lebanese villages to evacuate. An IDF spokesperson said "all options are on the table" when asked about a ground invasion.',
    fullContent: `Hezbollah fired rockets and drones at northern Israel beginning around midnight local time (22:00 UTC March 1). Multiple rockets struck open areas in northern Israel. Sirens sounded across Haifa and the Upper Galilee.

IDF response — within hours:
• IAF struck Hezbollah targets across three areas: southern Lebanon, Bekaa Valley, and Beirut's southern suburb (Dahieh).
• Residents of Beirut woke to explosions around 3 a.m. local time as Israeli strikes hit Dahieh — a densely populated commercial and residential area that serves as Hezbollah's stronghold.
• Lebanon's health ministry: 31 killed, 149 wounded from Israeli strikes.
• IDF ordered evacuation of nearly 50 Lebanese villages.

IDF chief of staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir: "We have launched an offensive campaign against Hezbollah. We must be prepared for several days of fighting — many."

IDF spokesperson to reporters: "Hezbollah made a very bad mistake by choosing to strike Israel overnight. The IDF will react very swiftly and they will pay a heavy price. All options are on the table."

When asked specifically about a ground invasion of Lebanon: "All options are on the table."

The Hezbollah attack breaks the November 2024 US-brokered Israel-Lebanon ceasefire. This is the first time Hezbollah has formally joined Iran in retaliatory action against Israel during the current conflict. ISW/CTP previously assessed Hezbollah possesses ~130,000 rockets — the most densely rocket-armed non-state actor in history.`,

    location:  'RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus',
    summary:   'An Iranian drone struck RAF Akrotiri, a UK sovereign base in Cyprus, at approximately midnight local time. No casualties reported but the Ministry of Defence confirmed a "suspected drone strike" and evacuated military families living on the base. Cypriot President Christodoulides confirmed it was an Iranian drone. The strike came hours after PM Starmer authorized US use of UK bases for defensive operations — effectively dragging an EU member state\'s territory into the conflict. Reuters described it as "a marked escalation."',
    fullContent: `UK Ministry of Defence spokesperson: "Our armed forces are responding to a suspected drone strike at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus at midnight local time."

Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides confirmed it was an Iranian drone, per BBC News.

Details:
• The drone struck RAF Akrotiri at approximately midnight local time (22:00 UTC March 1).
• Limited damage, no casualties.
• MoD evacuated military families living on the base as a precaution (Daily Mail confirmed).
• Officials believe the drone originated from Iran or an Iranian proxy (possibly Houthi or IRGC launch from Iraq/Syria).

Strategic significance:
• RAF Akrotiri is a British Sovereign Base Area — UK sovereign territory, not Cypriot.
• The strike came hours after PM Starmer gave consent for the US to use UK bases (including Akrotiri) for defensive operations against Iranian missiles and drones.
• This makes it the first direct Iranian strike on a European NATO ally's territory.
• Reuters described it as "a marked escalation effectively dragging an EU member state's sovereign territory into the conflict."
• Cyprus is an EU member; an attack on its sovereign base areas raises questions about NATO Article 5 (UK is NATO member) and EU mutual defense obligations.

UK Defence Secretary John Healey convened an emergency COBRA meeting. UK military posture has shifted from "enabling defensive operations" to "directly under attack."`,

All crew members bailed out safely and were checked at a hospital in stable condition. Video footage showed at least one F-15 spinning to the ground while on fire. The crashes came during an intense period of Iranian fire targeting Kuwait. The cause is under investigation — unclear whether the aircraft were shot down by Iranian missiles/AA or suffered mechanical failures under combat conditions.',
    fullContent: `Kuwait's Ministry of Defence statement: "Several United States military aircraft crashed this morning. All crew members survived."

Details:
• Kuwait MOD did not specify the number or type of aircraft involved.

• Separate footage showed a pilot being ejected and recovered.
• CNN confirmed "several" aircraft crashed based on Kuwait MOD statement.
• All pilots bailed safely; being treated at a hospital in stable condition.
• The incident occurred during intense Iranian missile and drone fire targeting Kuwait.

Analysis:
• The cause is under investigation. Possibilities include: (1) Iranian anti-aircraft missiles, (2) Iranian drone collision, (3) friendly fire from air defense systems, (4) mechanical failure under combat stress.
• Kuwait already lost 3 US service members in the conflict (Army sustainment unit, March 1).

Bloomberg and Reuters confirmed the shutdown. The refinery is on the Persian Gulf coast, directly exposed to Iranian drone and missile range. Separately, Israeli and Kurdish oil and gas fields were also shut amid the strikes.

Reuters confirmed: "Saudi Arabia shut its biggest domestic oil refinery on Monday after a drone strike, a source said, as Israeli and U.S. strikes and Iranian retaliation forced shutdowns of oil and gas facilities across the Middle East."

Ras Tanura details:
• Capacity: 550,000 barrels per day — largest in the Middle East.
• Located on the Persian Gulf coast in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province.
• Previously targeted in 2021 by Houthis (no damage then).
• Saudi defence ministry said it downed incoming drones with no injuries.
• Aramco shut the refinery "as a precaution" while assessing damages.

Broader energy impact:
• Reuters: "Israeli and U.S. strikes and Iranian retaliation forced shutdowns of oil and gas facilities across the Middle East."
• Kurdish oil and gas fields also shut amid the conflict.
• Israeli energy infrastructure affected.
• Combined with Hormuz closure and tanker attacks, this is the most severe supply disruption since 1973.

This directly contradicts Trump, who told The Atlantic that Iran\'s new leadership "wanted to talk" and that he had "agreed to talk."

"We will not negotiate with the United States."

In a follow-up post, Larijani wrote that President Trump's "wishful thinking" had dragged the region into an unnecessary war.

Context:
This directly contradicts Trump, who in an interview with The Atlantic said: "They want to talk and I have agreed to talk, so I will be talking to them. They should have done it sooner. They should have given what was very practical and easy to do sooner. They waited too long."

Analysis:
• Larijani is a powerful conservative figure — Secretary of the SNSC is arguably the most influential security role after the Supreme Leader.
• His public rejection suggests the hardline faction (backed by IRGC remnant leadership and Mohseni-Ejei on the interim council) is overriding any diplomatic signals from reformist President Pezeshkian.
• The Omani FM's backchannel efforts from March 1 now appear undercut.
• A US official had told Al Jazeera on March 1 that the conflict would "last for weeks, not just days" — Larijani's statement confirms there is no near-term diplomatic off-ramp.`,

"We cannot rule out a possible radiological release with serious consequences, including the necessity to evacuate areas as large or larger than major cities."

"Let me underline that the situation today is very concerning. Iran and many other countries in the region that have been subject to military attacks have operational nuclear power plants and nuclear research reactors, as well as associated fuel storage sites, increasing the threat to nuclear safety."

He listed at-risk facilities:
• UAE: 4 operating nuclear reactors (Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant).
• Jordan and Syria: Operational nuclear research reactors.
• Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia: "These countries all use nuclear applications of some sort. We therefore urge utmost restraint in all military operations."

On Iran's struck facilities: "We have no indication that any of the nuclear installations, including the Bushehr nuclear power plant, the Tehran research reactor, or other nuclear fuel cycle facilities have been damaged or hit. Efforts to contact the Iranian nuclear regulatory authorities continue with no response so far."

He expressed "a strong sense of frustration" that negotiations had failed: "Diplomacy is hard, but it is never impossible. Nuclear diplomacy is even more difficult, but it's never impossible."

    summary:   'In an interview with the Daily Mail, Trump said the operation against Iran could take approximately four weeks. "It was always a four-week process. It\'s a big country. It will take four weeks or less." This was the first time the US president gave a specific timeline for the operation. Separately, Trump told Fox News that 48 leaders had been killed.

    fullContent: `Trump interview with the Daily Mail (published March 1/2):

"It was always a four-week process. It's a big country. It will take four weeks or less."

This was the first specific operational timeline given by the US president.

Related statements:
• Trump to Fox News: "Nobody can believe the success we're having. 48 leaders are gone in one shot."
• US official to Al Jazeera: The conflict would "last for weeks, not just days" and continue "until it can guarantee Iran does not possess nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles."
• CBS News headline: "Trump says Iran operation could take 'four weeks or less,' 3 U.S. troops killed."

Analysis:
A 4-week timeline suggests the US is planning an extended air campaign, not a quick strike-and-withdraw. This aligns with:
• Continued IDF strikes on IRGC command infrastructure (Day 2-3).
• Task Force Scorpion Strike drone operations (ongoing).
• Systematic destruction of Iran's navy (9 warships, naval HQ).
• SEAD operations degrading Iranian air defense.
• The opening of the Lebanon front (complicating Israeli focus).

The timeline also explains why the US is not rushing to negotiate — Trump sees this as a methodical campaign with defined objectives, not a punitive raid.`,
